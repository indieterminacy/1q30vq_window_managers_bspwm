For the first part, why not just start vlc later:
urxvtc -name rtorrent -e rtorrent
#presel right
bspc window -p right
urxvtc -name URthree
#presel up
bspc window -p up
vlc &
For the second part, `bspc window -e left RATIO` should work. However, if you are already using presel, you could just add `-r RATIO` flags to the presel commands.

bspc window -r 50 -e left push or something similar.
Probably:
bspc window -e left 0.5

What happened to being able to move a window into the preselected area?
The new way for doing this is:
bspc window -w last.manual

Add this to your bspwmrc:
bspc rule -a Kupfer.py --focus


.xinitrc is as follows:
[ -e /tmp/panel-fifo ] && rm /tmp/panel-fifo
mkfifo /tmp/panel-fifo
bspwm -s /tmp/panel-fifo

bspwm -s /tmp/panel-fifo
This will work better:
bspwm -s /tmp/panel-fifo -p
